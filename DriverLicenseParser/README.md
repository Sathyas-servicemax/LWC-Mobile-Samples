# DriverLicenseParser

This project contains sample code on how to use the Nimbus Barcode Scanner plugin to scan PDF417 barcodes on driver licenses containing AAMVA-compliant payload and parse the payload. The `aamvaParser` utility library contains the code for parsing the barcode payload. `parserDemo` is an LWC component that demonstrates how to use `aamvaParser`.
